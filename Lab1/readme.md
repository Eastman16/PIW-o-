# Tranquil Travels Website
## Description
This project involves implementing specific views for the "Tranquil Travels" website as designed in Figma by the instructor (https://github.com/Nat3005). The development was based on initial HTML and CSS code provided by the instructor, with a focus on replicating these designs accurately. Responsive design techniques were applied to ensure the website adapts to different device widths, and basic interactivity was introduced through modal dialogs.

## Demonstration
Below, the implemented views from the project are showcased, highlighting how the designs from Figma were brought to life in the actual website:
